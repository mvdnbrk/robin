Notes:
- This plan fits in Universe 1 (addresses 001–244 used). Leave remaining addresses for future expansion.
- If you select different DMX modes (e.g., extended/pixel modes), update channel counts and shift subsequent start addresses accordingly.
- Terminate the last fixture with a 120 Ω DMX terminator.

Note: If using Engine Lighting with SoundSwitch, you can auto-generate shows from track metadata and BPM, and map fixtures via Fixture Profiles. Ensure all fixture profiles exist in the SoundSwitch library.

---

### Setup Checklist
- Update Engine OS and Engine DJ Desktop to latest versions
- Enable Engine Lighting and test basic looks (static, auto, and strobe)
- Patch all fixtures in SoundSwitch and verify addressing matches physical rig
- Soundcheck: gain staging, limiters, and crossover settings on subs/tops
- Safety: secure all fixtures with safety bonds; tape or ramp all floor cables; RCD in-use
- Label all cables and pack by length/type for faster teardown

---

### How to Run the Rig (Step-by-Step)

### 1) Pre‑Event Preparation
1. Prepare the SM7dB and confirm phantom power (if using built-in preamp) on the mixer/interface.
2. Prepare the Sennheiser XS 1 and connect via XLR.
3. Update Engine OS on the controller and Engine DJ Desktop if needed.
4. Sync your Engine DJ library to the SC5000M’s internal 1 TB drive (or to your performance USB) and verify playlists load.
5. Open SoundSwitch and verify the venue/light show project. Export show data to the Engine drive if using Engine Lighting.
6. Label cable bundles by length (short/medium/long) and fixture groups.

### 2) Room Layout and Power
1. Place DJ booth where power is available and safe from foot traffic/spills.
2. Position PA: place Bose F1 subs and tops left/right of dance floor, slight toe-in.
3. Position truss to left/right of booth. Ensure overhead clearance; secure fixtures with safety bonds.
4. Run a dedicated power run to audio and a separate one to lighting where possible to reduce noise.
5. Use RCD/RCBO protection. Keep cables along walls; cross walkways with cable ramps.
6. Place GS108 switch near the mixer and connect Ethernet to X1850 and SC5000M units (optional laptop to GS108).

### 3) Build Audio
1. Place subs and tops. Power off everything.
2. Connect controller master out to subs (XLR L/R). From subs’ high-pass outs to tops (XLR L/R).
3. Connect booth out to booth monitors (TRS/XLR).
4. Connect microphone(s): SM7dB via XLR to mixer input (enable phantom if using built-in preamp); XS 1 via XLR (no phantom required).
5. Power on sequence: controller → subs → tops → booth monitors.
6. Set initial gains: controller master at 0 dB, channel gains to unity, subs/tops input gains noon; limiters on.

Using XENYX 1204USB (optional):
- Route mics into XENYX channels; send XENYX main outs to X1850 line inputs (L/R) for FOH.
- Or use XENYX USB to record the event on a laptop; set the USB routing per the manual.

Bose F1 wiring (recommended):
- Connect X1850/Controller Master L/R to Bose F1 Subwoofer L/R inputs.
- From each Sub, connect HPF/Thru Out to the corresponding F1 Model 812 input (L → Left, R → Right).
- On the Sub, set HPF to engage the internal crossover; start with Sub level at 12 o’clock; adjust during soundcheck.
- On the 812 tops, set input level around 12 o’clock; select array pattern to suit coverage; fine-tune during soundcheck.

### 4) Build Lighting (DMX)
1. With power off, mount fixtures on T-bars/truss using rated clamps and safety bonds.
2. Daisy-chain DMX from Control One DMX out to first fixture, then through the chain.
3. Set fixture DMX addresses to match the DMX Layout table above; set DMX mode/channel count per the plan.
4. Plug in power to each fixture. Use IEC/PowerCON as applicable. Keep DMX and power separated where possible.
5. Place a DMX terminator at the last fixture in the chain.

### 5) Engine Lighting / SoundSwitch Setup
Option A: Engine Lighting (no laptop during show)
- In controller settings, enable Engine Lighting.
- Insert the Engine/SoundSwitch USB drive. Load a track and open Lighting view to verify looks.
- Select venue/show profile if prompted. Test static, color, movement, and strobe looks.

Note: SoundSwitch Control One requires a laptop running SoundSwitch software.

Option B: Laptop with SoundSwitch + Control One
- Connect Control One to the laptop via USB. In SoundSwitch, verify Control One is detected (and set as the DMX interface if using its outputs).
 - If not using Control One DMX outputs, select your USB DMX interface in preferences.
- Open your show project, confirm fixtures are patched/profiled, and addresses match hardware.
- Use Control One pads/encoders:
  - Autoloops: trigger and adjust intensity/color/movement banks
  - Static Looks: select static scenes for dinner/speeches
  - Strobe/Blinder/Smoke: dedicated buttons
  - Blackout: master blackout toggle
  - Next/Previous: step through programmed looks
- Start Autoloops or trigger scripted shows. Verify output on fixtures.

### 6) Soundcheck
1. Play a reference track at performance level. Adjust sub/top input gains and crossover as needed.
2. Walk the room. Balance left/right and sub/top levels. Avoid clipping; keep headroom.
3. Check mics for feedback; apply HPF and moderate EQ on the controller.
4. Confirm lighting reacts to BPM and looks appropriate for the venue.

### 7) During the Event
- Keep controller master around 0 dB; use channel faders and EQ for mixing.
- Use Booth level to control your monitor volume independently.
- For lighting, toggle between Autoloops/Static Scenes for slow songs vs energetic looks for peak moments.
- Use blackout for speeches or as needed; avoid excessive strobe.

### 8) Teardown and Packing
1. Power down sequence: booth monitors → tops → subs → controller → lighting fixtures.
2. Remove DMX terminator; coil DMX and audio cables with over-under technique; velcro and bag by length.
3. Remove fixtures; keep clamps and safety bonds with each fixture case.
4. Pack controller, mics, and accessories. Verify all items against Packing Checklist.
5. Inspect the area; remove tape and cable ramps.

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Guide
- No sound from tops: check master output routing, sub high-pass outs, input gains, and mute/limit LEDs.
- Hum/buzz: separate audio and lighting power, use balanced cables, lift ground on DI (not on mains!).
- No DMX response: verify addresses/mode, DMX polarity, terminator in place, and interface selected.
- Flickering lights: replace suspect DMX cable, check terminator, reduce cable run length if possible.
- Engine Lighting not working: confirm Engine Lighting enabled and SoundSwitch data on the drive.
